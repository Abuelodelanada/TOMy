TOMy: Terminal Of MySQL
=======================

My own MySQL client, which I hope to have more features than the original ;-)

Now, I have implemented the following features:

 - Save data connections to .connections file
 - Support multiple connections
 - Configurable color results in .config file
 - Configurable prompt in .config file
 - Autocomplete sentences with databases, tables and fields names.
 - Save (recover and remove) executed queries to saved_queries.txt file.
